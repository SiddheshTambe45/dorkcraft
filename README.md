🕵️‍♂️ DorkCraft

A lightweight OSINT dork builder – no backend required.

🌟 Overview

DorkCraft is a single-page web app that helps you quickly create advanced search engine dork queries without memorizing complex operators.

Do not use it for unauthorized access or illegal activities.

The tool only constructs queries; search engines handle the results.

💡 Why This Exists

During OSINT work, testers often waste time remembering exact dork operators or copy-pasting queries.
DorkCraft was created as a fun side project to solve one small but common pain point with a minimal, easy-to-use interface.

Simple idea. Minimal interface. One problem solved well.
